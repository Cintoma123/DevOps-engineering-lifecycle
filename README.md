DevOps Lifecycle

# Foundational DevOps Concepts

DevOps is a combination of development and operations. It's a culture and set of practices that bring software developers and IT operations together to work more efficiently. The main goal of DevOps is to shorten the software development life cycle and continuously deliver high-quality applications.

# The core principles of DevOps 
This include collaboration, automation, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), monitoring, and feedback. It encourages teams to break silos and work together throughout the product lifecycle, from planning to monitoring.

# DevOps Lifecycle Stages

- *Planning:* This is where teams gather requirements and define the goals of the project. Everyone involved aligns on what needs to be done.
  
- *Development:* Code is written and features are built based on the plan. Developers use version control systems like Git to manage changes.
  
- *Building:* The code is compiled and converted into executable files or containers. Automation tools are used to build the application consistently.
  
- *Testing:* The application is tested to find bugs or issues. This includes automated and manual testing to ensure quality.
*Release:* Once testing is complete, the application is prepared for deployment. It is released to a staging environment or directly to users.
  
- *Deployment:* The app is deployed to production. CI/CD pipelines automate this process to make it faster and safer.
  
- *Operations:* The operations team ensures that the application runs smoothly in the live environment.
  
- *Monitoring:* The application is continuously monitored for performance, errors, and user behavior. Feedback is collected and used for future improvements.
